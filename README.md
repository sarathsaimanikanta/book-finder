## 🛠️ How I Built This

### 🏗️ **Architecture**

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── Header.js       # Navigation and branding
│   ├── SearchForm.js   # Search input with debouncing
│   ├── BookCard.js     # Book display component
│   ├── BookSection.js  # Horizontal book galleries
│   ├── FeaturedSections.js # Home page book collections
│   ├── Wishlist.js     # Wishlist management
│   └── Profile.js      # User profile and stats
├── styles/             # Component-specific CSS
├── utils/              # API utilities and helpers
└── App.js             # Main application component
```

### 🔧 **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern features (Grid, Flexbox, CSS Variables)
- **API Integration**: OpenLibrary REST API
- **State Management**: React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

### 🌐 **API Integration**

The app integrates with the OpenLibrary API to provide:

- **Book Search**: `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title={query}`
- **Subject-based Discovery**: `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?subject={subject}`
- **Cover Images**: `https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/{cover_id}-M.jpg`

### 🎯 **Key Implementation Details**

1. **Debounced Search**: Implemented 500ms debouncing to prevent excessive API calls
2. **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling for network failures
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 768px and 480px
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient re-renders using React keys and memoization
5. **Accessibility**: Proper focus management, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation
